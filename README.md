### PORTFOLIO PROJECT:

A personal portfolio landing page is a website that showcases your work, skills, and experience in a professional manner. It's a digital portfolio that allows potential clients or employers to learn more about you and your work. Personal portfolio landing pages typically include examples of your work, your professional background, and your contact information.


Personal portfolio landing pages are important because they can help you stand out in a crowded job market. They provide an opportunity to showcase your skills and experience in a way that is tailored to your personal brand. Having a personal portfolio landing page can also help you demonstrate your skills to potential clients or employers, even if you don't have a lot of work experience.


In addition, personal portfolio landing pages can be accessed from anywhere at any time, which means that potential clients or employers can view your work and contact information at their convenience. This makes it easier for them to learn more about you and potentially reach out for further discussion or opportunities.
